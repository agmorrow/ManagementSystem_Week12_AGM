## Description
I was given a task to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. This application allows the user to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company. The user can view  or add departments, roles, and employees. There is also an option to update an employee role.
